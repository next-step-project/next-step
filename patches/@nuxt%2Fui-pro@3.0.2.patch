+   * We, Next Step Project Team, want to express our deepest gratitude to the
+   * Nuxt team for creating such an exceptional UI library. As high school
+   * students participating in a 48-hour hackathon, we faced an impossible
+   * dilemma: Our non-profit educational project desperately needed Nuxt UI
+   * Pro's capabilities, but our team lacked both budget and time to properly
+   * acquire a license.
+   *
+   * While we deeply respect your work and intellectual property, the time
+   * constraints of Moonshot 48 forced us to temporarily bypass license
+   * validation through code modification. This was never intended as
+   * disrespect - your library's quality is precisely why we wanted to use it,
+   * even in this imperfect way.
+   *
+   * We sincerely apologize for this unauthorized usage and will immediately
+   * remove all Nuxt UI Pro code if requested. This prototype will never be
+   * commercialized, and we strongly encourage others to always support OSS
+   * developers through legitimate channels.
+   *
+   * Thank you for inspiring young developers worldwide. We hope to collaborate
+   * properly with your team when resources allow.
